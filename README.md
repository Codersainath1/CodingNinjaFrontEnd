Steps involve in making website :
1. First, I have make a HTML file with the help of normal notepad in HTML5 version in a standard form.
2. Making the html body along with the Tags and classes
3. Making a CSS file to design my crazy looking website.
4. Once, the hTML and CSS file is done, i started buiding the jS file for the same.
5. Now, this takes very much time as i don't know few things about some of the topics so,i studied them and made it back.
6. For the testing purpose , i share the source code with my mentors and friends , so making the project a done.
